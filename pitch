A: Conduct EDA (exploratory data analysis), for example, shooting hotspots diagram,
2pts and 3pts shooting classification, shooting ordering by opponents, etc.
  
B: Classification, use differnet types of classifiers to build the machine learning-classification model
to get the shot_made probability.

C: Compare performance of different classfiers and find reasons.

D: Build machine learning model by using ANN (artificial neural network) and evaluate its performance

E: Time series modelling and analysis of Kobe's shot performance over years, for example, shot made percentage,
2pts #, or 3pts #.
