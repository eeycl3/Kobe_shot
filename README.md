For data analysis project
# Kobe_shot

# Pitch Session
- A: Conduct EDA (exploratory data analysis), for example, shooting hotspots diagram,
2pts and 3pts shooting classification, shooting ordering by opponents, etc.   2.15- 2.21
 - 2pt, 3pt accuracy (bar graph)
 - shot attempts (distribution graph)
 - shooting accuracy(distribution graph)
 - correlation features 
    (1)play off vs shot made flag correlation
    (2)shooting area vs shot made flag correlation
    (3)opponent vs shot made flag correlation
    (4)game date(month) vs shot made flag correlation
 
- B: Classification, use differnet types of classifiers to build the machine learning-classification model
to get the shot_made probability.   2.22 - 3.4
 Â   
    - logistic regression
    - KNN
    - descision tree (random forest)
- C: Compare performance of different classfiers and find reasons and analysis.
    - update it to kaggle to test. 2.22 - 3.4 
- D: Build machine learning model by using ANN (artificial neural network) and evaluate its performance 3.4 - 3.9
- E: Time series modelling and analysis of Kobe's shot performance over years, for example, shot made percentage, 2pts #, or 3pts #.   3.10 - 3.15
