For data analysis project
# Kobe_shot

# Pitch Session
- A: Conduct EDA (exploratory data analysis), for example, shooting hotspots diagram,
2pts and 3pts shooting classification, shooting ordering by opponents, etc.   2.15- 2.21
  
- B: Classification, use differnet types of classifiers to build the machine learning-classification model
to get the shot_made probability.   2.22 - 3.4
    
    - logistic regression
    - KNN
    - descision tree (random forest)
- C: Compare performance of different classfiers and find reasons and analysis.
    - update it to kaggle to test. 2.22 - 3.4 
- D: Build machine learning model by using ANN (artificial neural network) and evaluate its performance 3.4 - 3.9
- E: Time series modelling and analysis of Kobe's shot performance over years, for example, shot made percentage, 2pts #, or 3pts #.   3.10 - 3.15
